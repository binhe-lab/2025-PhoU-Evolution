_Background_
- phosphate is both essential and **toxic**
	- 
- _E. coli_ has a single "accessory" regulator protein PhoU
	- PhoU and an ABC-type phosphate importer together _suppresses_ the phosphate starvation response and is ==essential for viability==.
	- This study finds that other bacteria frequently possess multiple PhoU paralogs.
- Pi homeostasis in _E. coli_
	- uses a two-component signal transduction system (TCS), PhoBR, which does not directly sense Pi.
	- activity of the sensor kinase PhoR is controlled by a single accessory protein, PhoU.
	- in conjunction with the PstSCAB Pi-importer, PhoU is thought to sense the import of Pi and represses PhoBR activity when Pi-flux is high.
	- Limitation: while many bacterial species possess homologs of PhoBR, PstSCAB and PhoU, the _E. coli_ system fails to capture the diversity of phosphate uptake and homeostasis machinery present across bacteria.
- _S. aureus_
	- opportunistic pathogen
	- colonizes approximately 30% of the global population
	-

> - PstSCAB: Pi-importer

_Phylogenetic part_
- 926 genomes from across the bacterial tree of life were evaluated for the presence of
	1. the _S. aureus_ Pi-responsive PhoPR (PhoP = PhoB in _E. coli_)
	2. homologs of the PstSCAB, PitA and NptA Pi importers
	3. PhoU-like proteins (PhoU, PitR and the PhoU-like domain of NptA)

_Questions_
- Species selection
	- 926 genome from across the bacterial tree of life - breadth; pathogens over-represented;
	- query sequence: only names but no sequences or accession numbers provided
