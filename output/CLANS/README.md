## Use CLANS to cluster representative PhoU and PitR related proteins
2025-04-20

### Goal
Use [CLANS](https://github.com/inbalpaz/CLANS) to perform 2D or 3D clustering of the representative sequences for PhoU and PitR related proteins. See `../analysis/20250407-select-representative-proteins.Rmd` for details on the filtering procedure.

### Steps
I uploaded `../../data/fasta-sequences/20250404-cluster-sequences.sh` to the [CLANS webapp](https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/clans). There are no options to select. The run finished in about 10 minutes. I downloaded the run file here and also the `clans.jar` as `../../sw/clans.jar`.

Tomorrow I'll continue learning how to visualize the data.
